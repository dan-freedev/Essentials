    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an important tool for web developers as it enables them to access and modify
        the content and structure of HTML documents using JavaScript. Although we didn't cover how to make direct
        changes to HTML code in this section, we aimed to provide an introduction to the DOM to help you understand the
        structure of the DOM tree, as well as the relationships between its nodes. By gaining a better understanding of
        how the different components of HTML syntax relate to each other, we hope you're now better equipped to create
        effective and user-friendly web pages.</p>

Both the <kbd> and <samp> tags are useful for indicating specific types of content in a web page and can help make the page more accessible and easier to read for users. -->
