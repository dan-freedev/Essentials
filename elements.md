Inline Semantic Elements

Inline elements do not start on a new line and are typically used to change the meaning of a part of the text, without creating a new block or section. Examples include:

    <em> – emphasizes text, usually displayed in italics, indicating a subtle shift in tone or added stress on a word or phrase.
    <strong> – indicates strong importance or urgency of the text, commonly displayed in bold.
    <mark> – highlights parts of text for reference or emphasis, often with a background color.
    <cite> – used for referencing a title of a work, providing a semantic way to indicate sources or references.
    <q> – defines a short inline quotation.
    <dfn> – represents the defining instance of a term.
    <abbr> – denotes an abbreviation or acronym; the full definition can be provided in the title attribute.
    <data> – links the given content with a machine-readable translation (e.g., a product ID)
    <time> – represents a specific period or date, adding semantic meaning to times or dates within text.


Block-level Elements: <article>, and <h1> are used to structure the content. <article> wraps the content that stands on its own, and <h1> provides a heading for the article.
